            <hr>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <p class="big-p">Formed by three friends at the beginning of the COVID pandemic in Jan 2020, RTFKT was born in the metaverse, and this has defined us to this day.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-7 secondary-color">
                    <p class="small-p">RTFKT is an eclectic, future-focused, creator-led organization. We use the latest in game engines, NFTs, blockchain authentication and augmented reality, combined with design and manufacturing expertise to create unique experiences with phygital fashion, sneakers, and digital artifacts.</p>
                    <p class="small-p">We are known to create viral sneaker designs, collectible exclusives, 3D & AR wearables, unique avatars and original art. RTFKT has maintained a reputation of being more than a little ahead of the latest cutting-edge technology, a rep that has many mystified, as RTFKT would appear to lack the resources and manpower to rival giants in terms of research and development in the birth of digital fashion.</p>
                    <p class="small-p">Rumors around a rogue AI, used by RTFKT to create next-generation designs, are completely false and denied by RTFKT. There has been absolutely no evidence or legal action to justify these rumors.</p>
                    <p class="small-p">For many years, RTFKT was an undefined collective, working strictly in the shadows, providing designs and concepts to game companies and a few select fashion brands. But in 2020, RTFKT formed an entity to expand their services into the public metamarket. The response has been excellent, and RTFKT's social growth has been almost frightening.</p>
                    <p class="small-p">In 2021, we partnered with the legend, Takashi Murakami, to deliver our 20,000 Clone X avatar collection. In less than a year's time, we have seen Clone X community meet-ups all around the world, including cities such as: New York, Los Angeles, Paris, South Korea, Tokyo, London and many others. During this time, our community members have empowered each other to learn 3D tools, such as blender, and use their collective knowledge to create amazing, interactive experiences.</p>
                    <p class="small-p">The RTFKT project was scheduled to take off in 2040, but the human development in consciousness has accelerated faster than anticipated. We are here to accelerate our digital future now.</p>

                    <p>An NFT (non-fungible token) is a digital certificate for intellectual property recorded on a distributed ledger, such as a blockchain like Ethereum. NFTs can be anything that is digital, from collectibles and art pieces to music and even short movie segments ‚Äî the possibilities are endless. ‚ÄúNon-fungible,‚Äù more or less, means that an NFT is unique and cannot be replaced with something else. A Bitcoin is an example of a fungible token, which means you can trade one Bitcoin for another identical Bitcoin and you'll have exactly the same thing. NFTs are unique and thus non-fungible.</p>

                    <p>A wallet stores the public and private keys necessary to buy/sell/transfer all your digital assets, be it cryptocurrencies or NFTs. There are two main types of wallets‚Äîsoftware based ‚Äúhot wallets‚Äù and physical ‚Äúcold wallets.‚Äù There are a variety of differences between hot wallets and cold wallets, but the main difference is that hot wallets are connected to the internet, while cold wallets are kept offline.</p>
                    <p>Wallets are created and secured with a private seed phrase, and function similar to a browser extension (e.g. on Chrome, Firefox, Brave) that allows you to access DApps (decentralized applications) and perform crypto or NFT transactions. MetaMask is the most popular wallet currently in use in the NFT space.</p>

                <div class="col-md-7 small-p secondary-color">
                    <p>Gas fees are the transaction fees that users pay to validators on a blockchain protocol to have their transactions included in a block. The system works on a standard supply and demand mechanism. If there is more demand for transactions, validators can choose to include the transactions that pay more, compelling users to pay more to have their transactions processed quickly and efficiently. Users of Ethereum can also choose to pay more for faster transactions, by paying higher gas fees. Wallets like MetaMask enable users to interact directly with the Ethereum network, choosing which amount of gas they wish to pay. There are several websites where you can track gas prices, like <a href="https://ethgastation.info/">https://ethgastation.info/</a> or <a href="https://gasnow.org">https://gasnow.org</a>.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-7 small-p secondary-color">
                    <p>There are many ways to top up your wallet with ETH (the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain) to buy your first NFT.</p>
                    <p>The most common is to use cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase or Binance. There are different options but most of them allow you to exchange your fiat (in most international currencies) for cryptocurrency via card or wire transfer, which you can then transfer to your wallet.</p>
                    <p>Another method is to use the apps directly on the wallet which directs you to an integrated third-party exchange rail (i.e. MoonPay on MetaMask), which you can buy crypto using fiat/credit card directly into your wallet.</p>
                    <p>One more method is to use the exchange integrated on the marketplaces (i.e. Opensea or Rarible). Both have the option to use a credit card to make direct exchanges into crypto. When you are connected to the site with your wallet, click on your profile and there will be a button to add funds. When you finish, funds will be visible in your wallet. Regardless of method, the best way is to follow the steps according to each exchange or platform prepared for their users.</p>

                <div class="col-md-7 small-p secondary-color">
                    <p>A wallet created solely on your browser (e.g. MetaMask) is known as a ‚Äúhot wallet‚Äù. A hot wallet is a digital wallet that is kept online and can be accessed from any device if you have internet and your private keys. For hot wallets, private keys are stored and encrypted on the app itself which is online. Because hot wallets are online, they are easier to use for regular transactions, but they tend to be less secure and are subject to hacking and theft.</p>
                    <p>We recommend getting a ‚Äúcold‚Äù hardware wallet (e.g. Ledger or Trezor) which adds another layer of security. A hardware wallet is a type of ‚Äúcold wallet‚Äù that is a physical device, typically a USB. In general, a cold wallet is a wallet that is stored offline. Since cold wallets aren‚Äôt connected to the internet, they are less vulnerable to online hacks or thefts compared to a hot wallet. Some hardware wallets will provide you access to multiple Dapps, such as Metamask, and perform transactions as usual, with an added step of confirmation on the hardware wallet token physical device.</p>
                    <p>Regardless, best practices include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Never share your seed phrase or store it on your computer</li>
                        <li>Do not click on suspicious links you do not recognise, and</li>
                        <li>Store your precious assets on the ‚Äúcold wallet‚Äù while using the ‚Äúhot wallet‚Äù to perform transactions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Two commonly used ‚Äúcold‚Äù hardware wallets:</p>

                <div class="col-md-7 small-p secondary-color">
                    <p>There are many definitions in the wild but a good one is by Matthew Ball where he defines the metaverse as a ‚Äúmassively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds, which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence‚Äù.</p>
                    <p>In layman terms, the Metaverse is a virtual world where people can interact with one another and with their digital assets for different purposes and experiences.</p>
                    <p>This is producing a new opportunity for us in creating digital experiences and fashion.</p>
                    <p>We currently support many virtual world projects, such as Decentraland (Where we often provide wearable airdrops and are working on a METAMALL in the world), Sandbox and Ready Player Me.</p>
                    <p>One thing at RTFKT we are really excited about is AR technology, which will start to offer the opportunity for the virtual worlds to merge even more with the physical world, changing how we view fashion today and in the future.</p>

                    <p>In order to ensure that the NFT has not been forged yet, please check before purchasing with our ‚ÄúRedemption Checker‚Äù tool, which will be live on the website during every forging event.</p>

                    <p>Our latest phygital drops come with NFC tags embedded in the physical item (e.g. Space Drips, Clone X Forge SZN1). Connecting to the corresponding NFTs proves its provenance and allows anyone easy access and verification of the product and its details.</p>
                    <p>Upon receiving the physical items, scan the NFC tag with your mobile device, which will direct you to a webapp for you to connect to your wallet, and then follow the steps to connect the corresponding NFT to the NFC tag.</p>
                    <p>To do so on a desktop browser, start by scanning the NFC tag on your mobile, then click on ‚ÄúContinue on Desktop‚Äù, and follow the prompts to scan the QR code generated on the RTFKT.com website. Note that on the website, you must be logged in to your account and have the relevant wallet connected before proceeding with these steps.</p>
